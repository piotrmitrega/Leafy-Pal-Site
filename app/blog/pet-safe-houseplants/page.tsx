        common houseplants are toxic to pets. However, with the right information, you can build a lush indoor garden
        that's beautiful and safe for your furry companions.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1F682E] mt-8 mb-4">Tips for a Pet-Friendly Plant Space</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Strategic placement:</strong> Keep toxic plants out of reach or avoid them entirely.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Elevation is key:</strong> Use hanging planters or shelves to elevate greenery.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Training works:</strong> Train pets to respect boundaries, but assume some curiosity.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Monitor new additions:</strong> When bringing a new plant home, observe how your pets interact with
          it.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          <strong>Create pet distractions:</strong> Provide pet-safe grasses or catnip to redirect your pet's
          plant-chewing tendencies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-[#E9F2C5] p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1F682E] mb-3">Warning Signs of Plant Toxicity</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">If your pet has ingested a toxic plant, watch for these symptoms:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-0">
          <li className="mb-2">Vomiting or diarrhea</li>
          <li className="mb-2">Drooling or difficulty swallowing</li>
          <li className="mb-2">Lethargy or unusual behavior</li>
          <li className="mb-2">Swelling of the mouth, tongue, or lips</li>
          <li className="mb-0">
            If you suspect your pet has eaten a toxic plant, contact your veterinarian immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1F682E] mt-8 mb-4">Tech to Help You Choose Wisely</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Choosing the right plant can be overwhelming, especially when browsing a greenhouse filled with unfamiliar
        names. Apps like Leafy Pal can scan a plant's photo and tell you if it's safe for pets. You can also filter your
        collection by pet-safe tags and get personalized care instructions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1F682E] mt-8 mb-4">Proactive Care = Fewer Emergencies</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Beyond choosing non-toxic plants, keeping your plants healthy and well-located reduces the risk of pets nibbling
        on leaves out of boredom or hunger. Use reminders from Leafy Pal to stay on top of watering and feeding, so your
        plants look good and stay out of harm's way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1F682E] mt-8 mb-4">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Pet-safe plant choices mean peace of mind for plant lovers and pet owners alike. With the right combination of
        knowledge, care, and a little help from technology, your home can be a green, safe haven for everyone who lives
        there.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Remember, even with non-toxic plants, it's best to discourage pets from making your houseplants their snack. A
        balanced approach of pet-safe plants, strategic placement, and gentle training will help your indoor garden and
        furry friends coexist beautifully.
