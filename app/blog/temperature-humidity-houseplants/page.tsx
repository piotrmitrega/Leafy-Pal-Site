      <h2>Why Temperature and Humidity Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Most houseplants are tropical or subtropical species that evolved under specific climate conditions. When we
        bring these plants into our homes, we're asking them to adapt to an environment that can be drastically
        different from their natural habitat. Understanding and controlling temperature and humidity are crucial to
        helping your plants not just survive, but thrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Temperature Requirements for Common Houseplants</h2>
      <p>
        Most houseplants prefer temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) during the day and about 10°F (5°C) cooler at
        night. However, different plant groups have different preferences:
      </p>

      <h3>Tropical Plants</h3>
      <p>Plants like Monstera, Philodendron, and Pothos prefer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Daytime: 70-85°F (21-29°C)</li>
        <li>Nighttime: 65-70°F (18-21°C)</li>
        <li>Minimum: 55°F (13°C)</li>
      </ul>

        />
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding Humidity Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Humidity is often overlooked but is just as important as temperature for many houseplants. Most homes,
        especially in winter with heating systems running, have humidity levels between 10-30%, while most tropical
        plants prefer 40-60% or higher.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating the Ideal Climate for Your Plants</h2>
      <p>Here are practical ways to control temperature and humidity for your houseplants:</p>

      <h3>Temperature Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid extreme fluctuations - Keep plants away from heating vents, air conditioners, and drafty windows</li>
        <li>Consider microclimates - Different areas of your home have different temperatures</li>
        <li>Seasonal adjustments - Move plants away from cold windows in winter</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Humidity Management</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Humidity trays - Place plants on trays with pebbles and water</li>
        <li>Group plants together - Plants release moisture through transpiration</li>
        <li>Room humidifiers - Especially useful in winter when indoor air is dry</li>
        <li>Misting - Can provide temporary relief but is not a long-term solution</li>
      </ul>
