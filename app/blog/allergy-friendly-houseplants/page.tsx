              To maximize the benefits of these allergy-friendly plants while
              minimizing any potential issues, follow these care guidelines:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
              <li>
                Ensure proper ventilation in rooms with plants to prevent excess
                humidity that could lead to mold growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid overwatering, as standing water can become a breeding
                ground for mold and bacteria that might trigger allergies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regularly dust plant leaves with a damp cloth to prevent dust
                accumulation, which can harbor allergens.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep plants away from air vents and high-traffic areas to
                minimize dust distribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consider using a layer of decorative pebbles or aquarium gravel
                on top of the soil to reduce mold spores from the soil.
              </li>
            </ul>

              plant-filled home that supports your respiratory health rather
