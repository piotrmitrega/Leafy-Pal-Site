      <h2>Prevention: Your First Line of Defense</h2>
      <p>The best way to deal with pests is to prevent them from establishing in the first place:</p>

      <h3>Quarantine New Plants</h3>
      <p>
        Always isolate new plants for at least 2-3 weeks before introducing them to your collection. This allows time
        for any hidden pests to become visible.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep new plants in a separate room if possible</li>
        <li>Inspect thoroughly before purchasing</li>
        <li>Consider preventative treatments during quarantine</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Regular Inspection</h3>
      <p>Make it a habit to check your plants regularly for early signs of pests.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check undersides of leaves and leaf axils</li>
        <li>Look for discoloration, stippling, or unusual growth</li>
        <li>Use a magnifying glass for thorough inspection</li>
        <li>Pay special attention to plants that have had issues before</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Optimal Growing Conditions</h3>
      <p>Healthy plants are more resistant to pest infestations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide appropriate light, water, and nutrients</li>
        <li>Avoid stressing plants with dramatic environmental changes</li>
        <li>Ensure good air circulation around plants</li>
        <li>Clean dust from leaves regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Smart Watering Practices</h3>
      <p>Many pests thrive in specific moisture conditions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow soil surface to dry between waterings to deter fungus gnats</li>
        <li>Avoid overwatering, which stresses plants and creates favorable conditions for pests</li>
        <li>Water in the morning to allow foliage to dry during the day</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment Strategies: From Gentle to Aggressive</h2>
      <p>
        When prevention fails, it's time to take action. Start with the least invasive methods and escalate as needed:
      </p>

      <h3>Physical Removal</h3>
      <p>For light infestations, manual removal can be effective:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Washing:</strong> Rinse plants with a strong stream of water to dislodge pests
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wiping:</strong> Use a damp cloth to wipe down leaves and stems
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pruning:</strong> Remove heavily infested parts of the plant
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alcohol swabs:</strong> Dab visible pests with isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab
        </li>
      </ul>

          fill
          className="object-cover"
        />
      </div>

      <h3>Homemade Remedies</h3>
      <p>These DIY solutions can be effective for mild to moderate infestations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Insecticidal soap:</strong> Mix 1 tablespoon mild liquid soap with 1 quart water
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neem oil solution:</strong> Mix 2 teaspoons neem oil and 1 teaspoon mild liquid soap with 1 quart
          water
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alcohol spray:</strong> Mix 1 part isopropyl alcohol with 4 parts water
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Garlic spray:</strong> Blend 4 cloves garlic with 2 cups water, strain, and dilute 1:10 with water
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Application tips:</strong> Test on a small area first, apply in the evening to prevent leaf burn, and
        treat all plant surfaces including leaf undersides.
      </p>

      <h3>Commercial Organic Products</h3>
      <p>When homemade remedies aren't enough, consider these options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ready-to-use insecticidal soap</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Neem oil products</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pyrethrin-based insecticides</strong> (derived from chrysanthemums)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Horticultural oils</strong> (suffocate insects)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diatomaceous earth</strong> (for soil-dwelling pests)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Biological Controls</h3>
      <p>Nature's own pest management can be brought indoors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Beneficial nematodes:</strong> Microscopic worms that attack soil pests
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Predatory mites:</strong> Feed on spider mites and thrips
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ladybugs:</strong> Voracious consumers of aphids
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lacewings:</strong> Eat aphids, mealybugs, and other soft-bodied pests
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Biological controls work best in greenhouse settings or large indoor gardens, as they
        need sufficient prey and space.
      </p>

      <h3>Systemic Insecticides</h3>
      <p>For severe infestations or valuable plants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applied to soil and absorbed by plant</li>
        <li>Toxic to pests that feed on plant tissues</li>
        <li>Longer-lasting protection than topical treatments</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Caution:</strong> Not suitable for edible plants or homes with pets that might chew on plants
        </li>
      </ul>
